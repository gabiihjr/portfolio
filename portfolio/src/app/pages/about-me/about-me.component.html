    <p>I'm a Fullstack Developer, in love with programming.</p>
    <p>I was born in Brazil, but I live in Argentina. I have a master's degree in Visual Arts, so I'm partial to visual
      development,
      but I also love working creatively in Backend development, especially with Java or C#. In Frontend, I have
      experience with React and Angular,
      especially using Typescript. </p>

    <p>I love being creative to solve the challenges that project development brings, applying logic to programming and
      seeing what had been idealized really working.</p>
